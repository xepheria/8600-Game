My name is Itzel.
I am a member of V.L.T.R.E.
That stands for Vacant and Lost Terrestrial Recovery Enterprise.
In other words, I work for a company that loots abandoned planets for resources.
...
My current mission has me traveling through an uncharted region of this galaxy.
That isn't out of the ordinary for this sort of job.
...
What in the world was that?
How did I not notice this planet in the ship's tracking system?
And that flash of light...I could have sworn I saw another ship approaching that planet as it happened.
...
Maybe this planet is worth checking out.
Uh-oh, now what?
Huh? I can't control my ship!
