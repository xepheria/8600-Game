My poor ship.
It looks like I'm stuck here until headquarters can send a rescue ship.
Hmm...I wonder what could have caused me to crash?
For now, I'll explore the area and see if I can find help.
With my boots I can control my friction with the ground beneath me!
In high friction mode, my boots will channel red energy to increase my grip. I can even walk upside down! But I can only use high friction mode as long as the battery is charged.
In low friction mode, I release blue energy and can slide across surfaces like an ice skater! Sliding also refills the high friction battery with red energy.
My boots can absorb blue energy containers to refill the battery as well. I think I can see some across this little valley!
That wasn't too difficult!
Hey, could that be some sort of teleportation device? This planet has some old technology!
Well, I'll just hop on over these spikes and check it out.
